## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Jace, and I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University Of Lethbridge interested in full-stack development particularly backend development.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my startup [TicketRelay](https://ticketrelay.net), where web developer clients can submit issues       to an agent and have automated pull requests made with the changes to fix the issues.
